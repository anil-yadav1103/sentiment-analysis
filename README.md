SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - TASK 4
Sentiment Analysis is a vital application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning that helps extract opinions, emotions, and sentiments from textual data. It is widely used in analyzing social media posts, customer reviews, feedback forms, news articles, and other text data to understand public opinion or customer satisfaction. This task focuses on performing sentiment analysis on textual data such as tweets, reviews, or comments using NLP techniques.

For this project, Python was used as the programming language, and the implementation was carried out in Google Colab for easy execution and visualization. We used a popular NLP library, TextBlob, which is built on top of NLTK and provides simple yet powerful tools for text processing and sentiment scoring.

The task begins with data collection or creation where sample text data, such as product reviews, is prepared. This data represents real-world user opinions containing positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Following this, the data undergoes preprocessing, which involves cleaning the text, handling missing values, and preparing the data for sentiment analysis.

Next, sentiment analysis is applied to each text entry using the TextBlob library. TextBlob calculates the sentiment polarity of each sentence on a scale from -1 to 1, where:

Negative values indicate negative sentiment
Positive values indicate positive sentiment
Zero or near-zero values indicate neutral sentiment
Each review or text is then categorized as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on its polarity score. This classification provides a clear understanding of the emotional tone present in the data.

After classification, insights are generated through visualizations. A bar graph is created to display the number of positive, negative, and neutral reviews. This visualization helps in quickly understanding the overall sentiment trend in the dataset. The output also includes a sentiment count and displays how many reviews fall into each sentiment category.

Finally, the analyzed data, along with the sentiment labels, is saved into a CSV file for future reference or reporting purposes. This complete cycle from data collection to insights generation ensures that the project covers all essential aspects of a sentiment analysis task.

ðŸ”Ž Key Highlights of the Project:
Utilized TextBlob for sentiment scoring
Performed text preprocessing and cleaning
Implemented sentiment categorization based on polarity
Visualized sentiment distribution using Matplotlib/Seaborn
Exported results into a CSV file
Fully developed in Google Colab for easy sharing and execution
